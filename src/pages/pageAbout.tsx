                            About AirAlert
                        </h1>
                        <p>
                            AirAlert is an innovative IoT project for monitoring air quality. It collects real-time data
                            from various sensors<br/>
                            such as temperature, humidity, particulate matter (PM), or COâ‚‚ levels and presents it<br/>
                            visually on a user-friendly website.<br/><br/>

                            The goal of the project is to provide transparency about current air quality conditions
                            indoors or in the<br/>
                            surrounding environment and to raise awareness among users. With the help of smart sensors
                            and modern web technologies <br/>
                            AirAlert enables easy and visual analysis of environmental data â€“ anytime,
                            anywhere.

                        <p> We are a group of computer science students from Hochschule Harz who are<br/>
                            passionate about environmental technology and smart systems.<br/>
                            This project was developed as part of our coursework in the Web-Services und
                            -Infrastrukturen module <br/>
                            during the summer semester 2025.<br/><br/>

                        <h2 style={{fontSize: "20px", fontWeight: "bold"}}>Why AirAlert?</h2>

                        <p>
                            Our daily environment significantly impacts our health and well-being yet many people
                            are<br/>
                            unaware of the air quality in their homes, offices, or neighborhoods. <br/><br/>

                            The motivation behind AirAlert was to create a low-cost, easy-to-use system that makes<br/>
                            invisible data (like COâ‚‚ levels or fine dust) visible and understandable for
                            everyone.<br/><br/>

                            We aim to contribute to more awareness around environmental conditions and enable
                            smarter<br/>
                            decisions whether it's about ventilating a room or avoiding outdoor activities during
                            high<br/>
                            pollution periods.<br/><br/>
                        </p>

                        <h2 style={{fontSize: "20px", fontWeight: "bold"}}>Open Source & Collaboration</h2>
